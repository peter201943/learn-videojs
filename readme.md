## VideoJS Notes
- About: Created 2022-09-30 to learn about video players in web browsers, specifically [VideoJS](https://videojs.com/)
- Misc: Native video player must be muted to automatically play
- Setup: the `<video>` element `` date-setup `` attribute uses quoted-JSON, not JavaScript-object-literals
  - Example: `` data-setup='{"autoplay": "muted","controls": true, "loop": true} ``
    - Note: Must use quotation marks around keys
- CRUCIAL: `<video>`  must have `` data-setup="{}" `` attribute
- CRUCIAL: `<video>`  must have `` class="video-js" `` attribute
- CRUCIAL: `<body>`   must have `` <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script> `` element *after* all other elements
- CRUCIAL: `<head>`   must have `` <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet" /> `` element
- Feature: "Playlists" are not a native feature, and must be provided via plugins
- Feature: VideoJS plugins are not noteworthy enough to have common CDN's available, hence should be provided locally (via NPM)
- Requirement: Setup NPM for VanillaJS Website
- Misc: Consider placing all webpages in a `/pages/` folder, so as to keep the root directory clean
- Misc: Consider placing all resources into appropriate categorical folders
  - Example: Images and videos and audio in `/media/`
  - Example: Stylesheets in `/styles/`

## NPM Notes

  - Debugger for Chrome/Edge/Firefox
  - IntelliCode
  - (TODO: List used extensions for web development)
- Note: `npm` can be used in any folder-level (even within a project which already has npm in use - but this is an advanced technique - not recommended for beginning)
- Setup: `` npm init `` in appropriate folder
- Setup: Creates `node_packages` and places each plugin as a sub-directory
- Setup: Run `` npm install videojs `` to add VideoJS
