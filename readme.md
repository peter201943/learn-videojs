## VideoJS Notes
- About: Created 2022-09-30 to learn about video players in web browsers, specifically [VideoJS](https://videojs.com/)
- Misc: Native video player must be muted to automatically play
- Setup: the `<video>` element `` date-setup `` attribute uses quoted-JSON, not JavaScript-object-literals
  - Example: `` data-setup='{"autoplay": "muted","controls": true, "loop": true} ``
    - Note: Must use quotation marks around keys
- CRUCIAL: `<video>`  must have `` data-setup="{}" `` attribute
- CRUCIAL: `<video>`  must have `` class="video-js" `` attribute
- CRUCIAL: `<body>`   must have `` <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script> `` element *after* all other elements
- CRUCIAL: `<head>`   must have `` <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet" /> `` element
- Feature: "Playlists" are not a native feature, and must be provided via plugins
- Feature: VideoJS plugins are not noteworthy enough to have common CDN's available, hence should be provided locally (via NPM)
- Requirement: Setup NPM for VanillaJS Website
- Misc: Consider placing all webpages in a `/pages/` or `/public/` folder, so as to keep the root directory clean
- Misc: Consider placing all resources into appropriate categorical folders
  - Example: Images and videos and audio in `/media/`
  - Example: Stylesheets in `/styles/`
  - Example: Website-specific JavaScript in `/src/`
- Feature: Custom styling requires the base theme be included first, and then the custom theme

## NPM Notes
- Installation: Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) first (NPM is included and uses some NodeJS functions)
- Setup: Add Plugins to VS Code
  - Debugger for Chrome/Edge/Firefox
  - IntelliCode
  - (TODO: List used extensions for web development)
- Note: `npm` can be used in any folder-level (even within a project which already has npm in use - but this is an advanced technique - not recommended for beginning)
- Setup: `` npm init `` in appropriate folder
- Setup: Creates `node_packages` and places each plugin as a sub-directory
- Setup: Run `` npm install video.js `` to add VideoJS
- Setup: Run `` npm install videojs-playlist `` to add a VideoJS Plugin
- Setup: Run `` npm install @videojs/themes ``
- CRUCIAL: Node-style-javascript is *incompatible* with browser-style-javascript, a ***BUNDLER*** must be used to convert Node-Packages into useable Browser-Libraries (See [Bundler Notes](#bundler-notes))
- Misc: [Bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) and [LoDash](https://lodash.com/) are commonly included packages that just makes things better
  - (`` npm install bootstrap@v5.2.1 ``, `` npm install lodash ``)
  - Warning: LoDash requires *bundling* before using (See [Bundler Notes](#bundler-notes))

## Bundler Notes
- Setup: Run `` npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli `` (Note how webpack is not needed in the final website itself, so we do not save it for "production")
  - Alternative: Run `` npm install --global webpack webpack-cli `` (This installs it for a given computer, not just a given project)
- CRUCIAL: Must edit `packages.json` with relevant building parameters, see [YouTube: Module Bundlers Explained... Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, and Snowpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IG4UmULyoA) for details
- Execution: Run `` npm run build ``
- CRUCIAL: Most builders output results to `/dist/`, must link to `/dist/` from html (webpage code)
  - Example: Bundling Website Code
    - Old: `` <script type="module" href="../src/index.js"></script> `` 
    - New: `` <script type="module" href="../dist/main.js"></script> ``
- Ecosystem: There are a lot of bundlers, with their own annoying differences
  - WebPack: Requires lots of configuration, takes awhile to build
  - Parcel: 
  - Snowpack: Faster build times
